# Passma - Python Password Manager Program!
(Don't ask what the name means...)

!!NOT RECOMMENDED FOR NORMAL USE!! Made as a proof of concept, passwords are NOT stored in a secure format.

This program can be used to store account passwords and generate new, secure passwords! Passwords are stored and salted in a text file that can be retrieved with the program as well.

# Dependencies
In order for Passma to function, you must have Python3 installed!

# To install Python3:

For Windows Users, download it here: https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/

For MacOS Users, download it here: https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/

For Ubuntu/Debian based Linux Distros, run
```sh
sudo apt-get install python3
```

For Arch based Linux Distros, run
```sh
sudo pacman -S python3
```

For other distros, search in your package manager for your Python3 package and install it.


# Installation
If git is already installed and configured on your system, cd to where you want the program installed and run:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/vanssx3/Passma.git
```

If you do not have git installed already install it here with instructions for your OS: https://git-scm.com/downloads

If for some reason you are unable to install git on your computer, you can download passma.py and place it in a folder that you will run it from.

# Usage
This program runs in a terminal or command prompt. To run the program, make sure that you are in the same directory you downloaded the program in, then run 
```sh
python3 passma.py
```
You can enter list or gen into the prompt to either list a password, or to generate a new password. If you don't already have a password list, either method will create one for you! Follow the instructions to use it!
